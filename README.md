# Hey, I'm Elektra ðŸ‘‹
I am a dedicated software engineer with experience programming full stack apps from concept to completion. My motivation lies in my belief that just because something works well doesnâ€™t mean it canâ€™t be better: which I apply to both society and technology. My passion for coding stems from my excitement to find the most efficient piece for the puzzle, whether itâ€™s a small or large problem. I am looking to work with a team that shares my goals of being passionate about our work, approaches problems with a growth mindset, and a startup fast paced culture.


## Recent Projects
Iâ€™m currently working on a few freelance projects primarily in React. I recently graduated General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive where I completed several full stack applications. Iâ€™m currently teaching myself Ruby on Rails and I'll be programming a project with Rails soon.
